# Introduction


To use NFC tamper-proof technology, you can create an NFC tag for each ticket with the ticket information and a signature. The signature is generated using a secret key, which should be kept secure and known only to the ticket issuer. To verify the authenticity of the ticket, you can read the NFC tag and validate the signature using the same secret key.
