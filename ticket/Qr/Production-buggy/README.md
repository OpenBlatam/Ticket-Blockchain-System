Use nft ticket and only smart contract is buggy and do the complete capalities 

His own blockchain and conect with the ETH ecosystem protect for 51 % attacks 


Here are some suggestions for further optimization:

Use byte slices instead of strings wherever possible to avoid unnecessary conversions.

Cache the QR code generation to avoid generating the same QR code multiple times.

Use a faster hash function like xxHash instead of SHA-256 if the security requirements allow for it.

Use a faster encoding format like MsgPack instead of Protobuf if the size of the encoded data is a concern.

Use a smaller image size if the QR code is intended for display on small screens to reduce the size of the encoded data.

Consider compressing the serialized data before encoding it into a QR code to further reduce its size.

Consider using a custom error type instead of returning nil for error cases to provide more context to the caller.


## Better cryptohgraphy 

Use a secure hash function: SHA-256 is a good choice for a hash function, but you can also consider using SHA-3 or BLAKE2 for better security.

Use a key derivation function to generate a key from a password: If you are storing sensitive data such as private keys, it is recommended to use a key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt to generate a key from a password. This helps to protect against brute-force attacks on the password.

Use authenticated encryption: If you are encrypting data, it is recommended to use an authenticated encryption mode such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. This provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the data.

Use a secure random number generator: When generating random numbers for cryptographic purposes, it is important to use a secure random number generator such as the one provided by the crypto/rand package in Go.

Use a secure key management strategy: If you are storing keys, it is important to use a secure key management strategy to protect against theft or loss of the keys. This can involve using hardware security modules (HSMs), key management services (KMS), or other secure storage options.

Consider using multi-factor authentication: If you are using private keys to sign transactions, consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect against theft or unauthorized use of the keys. This can involve using hardware tokens or other forms of second-factor authentication.
