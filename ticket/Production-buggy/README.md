Use nft ticket and only smart contract is buggy and do the complete capalities 

His own blockchain and conect with the ETH ecosystem protect for 51 % attacks 


Here are some suggestions for further optimization:

Use byte slices instead of strings wherever possible to avoid unnecessary conversions.

Cache the QR code generation to avoid generating the same QR code multiple times.

Use a faster hash function like xxHash instead of SHA-256 if the security requirements allow for it.

Use a faster encoding format like MsgPack instead of Protobuf if the size of the encoded data is a concern.

Use a smaller image size if the QR code is intended for display on small screens to reduce the size of the encoded data.

Consider compressing the serialized data before encoding it into a QR code to further reduce its size.

Consider using a custom error type instead of returning nil for error cases to provide more context to the caller.
