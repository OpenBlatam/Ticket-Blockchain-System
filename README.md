## Description 


Ticket Creation: The first step in the process is the creation of a new ticket. This involves generating a unique identifier for the ticket and storing relevant information about the event, such as the date, time, and location.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are stored on the blockchain. In the case of a ticketing system, a smart contract would be created for each ticket that includes the terms and conditions of the ticket, as well as the rules for transferring or reselling the ticket.

Ticket Transfer: When a ticket is sold or transferred, the ownership of the ticket needs to be updated on the blockchain. This can be done using a transfer function within the smart contract that verifies the legitimacy of the transfer and updates the ownership information on the blockchain.

Ticket Resale: A resale function can also be included in the smart contract to allow ticket holders to resell their tickets. The resale function would include rules for setting the price of the ticket and ensuring that the transfer is legitimate.

Ticket Validation: To prevent fraud, the system would need a way to validate tickets at the event. This could be done by scanning a QR code on the ticket, which would then verify the ticket on the blockchain and ensure that it has not already been used.

Payment Processing: When a ticket is sold or resold, payment would need to be processed. This can be done using a cryptocurrency that is compatible with the blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Event Management: The event organizer would also need a way to manage the event and ensure that tickets are being used properly. This could be done using a separate system that integrates with the ticket blockchain system.
